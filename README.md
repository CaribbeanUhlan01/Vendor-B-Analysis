# Vendor-B-Analysis
This analysis takes a look at vendor information regarding inspections performed across several states between 2012-2022. Within it, exploratory analysis of the outcomes of inspections submitted by the vendor, as well as individual state stastics, are visualized. 

## Description
One of the first conclusions uncovered by these analusos was the fact that approximately 7% of all cases result in cancellations - the state with the highest likelihood of cancellations is NY:

Upon further research, it seems that the state where the vendor takes the longest time to complete inspections is AL.

Not surprisingly, replacement cost estimates significantly spiked during 2020:
